What Happens When You Type "https://www.google.com" in Your Browser

Do you know what happen when you type a simple URL like "https://www.google.com" into your browser and hit Enter? It seems like magic and very complicated, but in fact, it’s a complex series of processes that we will explain in this blog post.
First thing is that the process begins with your browser sending a Domain Name System (DNS) request to translate the human-readable domain name "www.google.com" into an IP address. This request is typically handled by your Internet Service Provider's (ISP) DNS server or a designated DNS resolver.
 Once the DNS server returns the IP address of the requested domain, your browser establishes a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) connection with the server associated with that IP address. TCP ensures reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of data packets over the internet.
 But before establishing a connection, the data packets may encounter firewalls – network security systems designed to monitor and control incoming and outgoing traffic based on predetermined security rules. If the request passes through the firewall, the connection is established.
Next is the most important thing in modern web browsing, which is the security. When accessing a secure website like Google, the connection is encrypted using the HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) protocol, which employs SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor TLS (Transport Layer Security) to ensure data confidentiality and integrity. This encryption prevents eavesdropping and tampering by malicious actors.
 We have to know that the large-scale websites like Google often utilize load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, optimizing performance and reliability. These load balancers ensure that no single server becomes overwhelmed and that users experience fast response times.
   Once the connection is established and encrypted, your browser sends an HTTP request to the web server hosting the requested webpage. In the case of Google, this request is directed to one of Google's many servers distributed globally.
   The web server processes the HTTP request and interacts with various application servers to generate dynamic content or retrieve stored data. In Google's case, complex algorithms may be executed to personalize search results or serve targeted advertisements based on user preferences and behavior.
   In some instances, the application server may need to retrieve data from a database to fulfill the request. Google, for example, relies on vast databases containing indexed web pages, user information, and other relevant data to generate search results.

As the requested data traverses through these layers of infrastructure, it undergoes processing, encryption, and retrieval, ultimately culminating in the delivery of the desired webpage to your browser. The entire process, which occurs within a fraction of a second, exemplifies the remarkable complexity and efficiency of modern internet technology.
